### 7. The intended way to use TMan

**Weekly planning**

At the end of or the start of a week, you populate the 'This week' task list with every task
you want to get done next week (or the current week). I recommend 15 tasks a week, if you feel
like you can do more, feel free to add more work load.

**Daily planning**

This should happen in the morning of every day, take a look at the 'Tomorrow' and 'This week' lists
and decide what you want to do today. Be careful of overcommitting, 3 tasks per day should be enough.
Clean up yesterday's tasks and move three tasks to the today list and reorder them as you like.

:bulb: **Tip**: Try to do the difficult tasks in the morning when you have the most willpower.

**During the day**

Check your current task and focus on only that until it is done! Then tackle the next task.

:bulb: **Tip**: Use the pomodoro technique to get started.
